-- Fix 1: Remove public SELECT policy on user_badges table
-- Drop the overly permissive public policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Everyone can view all user badges" ON public.user_badges;

-- Keep only authenticated users viewing their own badges (policy already exists: "Users can view their own badges")
-- No new policy needed as "Users can view their own badges" already provides owner-scoped access

-- Fix 2: Add RLS to leaderboard_global view
-- First, we need to recreate the view with security_invoker to respect RLS
-- Get current view definition and recreate with security_invoker

-- Drop existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.leaderboard_global;

-- Recreate the view with security_invoker
CREATE VIEW public.leaderboard_global
WITH (security_invoker = on)
